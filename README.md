# 👋 Hi, I'm Guillermo Prieto *(but I go by Memo)*

Welcome to my profile. You can call me **Memo** — it’s what I go by most of the time. I'm a **Software Developer** focused on building scalable, secure, and well-documented systems. I value clarity in code, thoughtful architecture, and systems that grow with time — not just quick wins.

> 🎯 **This profile is a commitment.** I use it to showcase not just my skills, but how I plan, organize, learn, and execute — even when the path is uncertain.

Outside of code, I'm deeply passionate about **world-building, storytelling, and immersive games like Dungeons & Dragons**. These hobbies influence how I build: structured yet flexible, imaginative yet pragmatic.

One of my dream projects in progress is a **D\&D interactive adventure platform**, where Dungeon Masters can upload their worlds and players can engage with quests, NPCs, and exploration tools even between sessions. It blends my technical expertise with my creative side — and I want it to evolve into a full SaaS solution for tabletop gaming communities.

## 🧗 What I’m Improving Right Now

My journey is driven by an intense hunger for learning — I want to understand **how everything works**, even if I don't build everything myself. I dive deep into ecosystems, explore the design behind each language, and learn to appreciate their philosophies.

Right now, I'm focused on:

* Expanding my skills across **multiple programming languages**, understanding their idioms, trade-offs, and strengths
* Building and managing **cloud-native infrastructure** with Kubernetes and Terraform (including bare-metal clusters)
* Exploring **cybersecurity practices** to better protect the systems I build
* Practicing **clean architecture, testing, and documentation** across all layers
* Cultivating **empathy and communication**, to understand not only the tech — but the humans building it

I truly believe that **how we work together matters more than the work itself**. The best teams are built on trust, shared growth, and mutual respect.

I'm still learning how to be the kind of teammate I’d want to work with — someone who listens, adapts, and contributes without ego. Collaboration, patience, and open-mindedness aren’t always easy, but I actively work on them like any other technical skill. I hope to find the right team where I can give my best and help others do the same.

## 🚀 Where I'm Going

I don’t just want to be a developer — I want to be a **technical architect**, a **builder of tools that outlive me**, and eventually a **CTO** helping shape meaningful products. I’m ambitious, but I back it with structure, grit, and reflection.

I believe in working hard *now* to open doors *later*. Whether it’s standing up a Kubernetes cluster bare-metal or designing an engine for dynamic storytelling, I treat every step as part of the climb.

## 💬 Core Values in My Work

* **No shortcuts**: I don’t ship without understanding why it works — depth over speed always.
* **Adaptability over familiarity**: I build in Go, Python, Ruby, Java, and C# because I believe in choosing the right tool for the job, not the one I’m most comfortable with.
* **Documentation matters**: I believe good code speaks for itself — and great code has a guide that others can follow and extend.
* **Growth over comfort**: I take on what I don’t fully know — not recklessly, but deliberately, to push beyond plateaus.
* **Empathy in development**: I try to think beyond code — about how it impacts teammates, future maintainers, and users.
* **Systems thinking**: I care about how things connect. A function might work, but does it make the system better?
* **Team > Task**: Good outcomes come from good people working together. I’d rather support my team than hit a goal at their expense.
